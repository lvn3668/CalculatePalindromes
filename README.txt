finds palindromes on double strands and finds inverted repeats
executable is palindrome 
palindrome <filename> <min seq length> <max seq length> <gap length> <max num of mismatcehs allowed> <score for match> <score for mismatch>
inverted repeats are stored in invertedrepeats.txt
palindromes on double strand are stored in palondubstrand.txt
inverted repeats are single stranded palindromes
readDNA.cpp reads the DNA sequence from the input file (<filename>)
pal.cpp is the main file which finds palindromes
pal.h is corresponding header file
